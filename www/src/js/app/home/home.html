                   I'm Jessy - a PR manager of influencers &amp; content creators and
                    an entertainer who discusses social justice, real talks, tallies fails, listens deeply &amp; giggles lots.

                    I've been playing video games before I could sit up. In 2014, I began casting to appease loneliness and
                    connect with others in an online couch gaming scenario. I want to create a safe, kind place for people to
                    either forget about their real life issues, or to support others through them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Unconditionally, video games are my passion. Without gaming, I wouldn't have my amazing relationships.
                    Video games are educational art forms that bring people from different subcultures together through the
                    emotions and memories experienced. Therefore, I'm consuming and promoting other creations gleefully.
